# WorkplaceX Backend

This is the backend response server and RESTful routing gateway for the WorkplaceX Project

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

There are a few things you will need to get this running on your local machine

* Make (Mac should just have it, Windows might need [this](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)])
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#desktop)

### Installing

This should install everything the apps need to run on your local machines.
```
cd workplace-api
make
```

### Usage

Seed the database (defaults to 200 records)
```
cd /path/to/items-server
npm run db:seed
```
